[![Atlantis Logo](assets/atlantis_logo.png)](https://www.runatlantis.io/) [![Cloud Run Logo](assets/cloud_run_logo.png)](https://cloud.google.com/run)

This repository aims to provide examples and collect best practices of how to deploy [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/) on Google Cloud Run.

Running Atlantis on Cloud Run comes with its own set of challenges, as Cloud Run is a serverless platform 
and Atlantis was built to run on a single server.

> **Note**: The examples in this repository may not be the best way to run Atlantis on Cloud Run.  
> While some of the examples have been used in this setup for some time now, there are still some issues that need to be addressed.
> 
> If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or a pull request.

Please share your experiences on running Atlantis on Cloud Run, so we can work together on the best configuration.
